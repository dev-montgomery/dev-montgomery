- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dev-montgomery
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ... being a good dad. I'm interested in pursuing art, whether it's storytelling, illustration, music, and/or coding.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... how to use tile map editors, using GIMP to create pixel sprites, and coding a 2d rpg based off a game I played growing up.
